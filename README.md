### What is OPHOIS?
OPOHIS is a Linux ssh jump/bastion host. OPHOIS would act as central point through which all DevOps and Support staff access Linux production servers. OPHOIS SSH gateway includes a lot of security features that would help you manage and administer thousands of Linux servers at ease.


### Motivation
OPHOIS named after Egyptian god Wepwawet AKA Ophois, he was God of War, Victory, Hunting, Lycopolis, Guardian of the Deceased, "Opener of the Ways" and Protector of Pharaoh and Egyptian Army [Wiki] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wepwawet)
